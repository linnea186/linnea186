I am Chiang Ting-Yu, currently a forth-year student in the Department of Information Management at Tunghai University. Due to my parents' work, they adopted a democratic education style for us from a young age, always giving us a lot of freedom to develop according to our abilities and interests. They never forced us to be perfect but encouraged us to do our best, which has shaped my independent, decisive personality.

During my one and a half years at Shih Chien University, I actively pursued my studies and achieved good results, earning a two-year internal scholarship. In addition to my basic coursework, I teamed up with several classmates to explore more about AI applications and information security. As a result, I participated in a campus community fundraising course. Although I was not good at communication, I wanted to push myself to try new things, so I took on the role of team leader, which helped me improve my communication, management, and coordination skills. With the support of my professors, I also obtained the Ministry of Economic Affairs Information Security Engineer â€“ Junior certification.

Eager to further enhance my skills, I registered for a transfer exam during the winter break. After receiving acceptance letters from various universities, I decided to transfer to Tunghai University. In my first semester, I worked hard to catch up with the required credits and earned excellent grades, receiving praise from my professors. By chance, I saw the promotion for a minor in the Department of Finance on campus. Driven by curiosity and interest, I decided to enroll in the minor courses. However, things were not as easy as I had imagined. I found that courses like Calculus and Financial Management required a strong foundation, and since my interest was more casual, I struggled to keep up with my classmates. As a result, I did not earn credits for those courses in the end. If I could do it again, I would make sure to prepare in advance, build a solid foundation, and then decide on my course plan, avoiding rash decisions.

My experience in joining the volleyball team has also deeply taught me the importance of discipline. This discipline has greatly helped me in daily life and academics, allowing me to complete tasks more efficiently. After participating in various competitions, I have learned how to remain calm under pressure, analyze problems, and take effective measures to resolve them. I have also learned how to face setbacks, learn from them, and approach the next challenge with a more determined attitude. In summary, these experiences and qualities from being part of the volleyball team will become valuable assets in my future life, helping me find the most suitable direction in my path of diverse development and becoming a more well-rounded and excellent person.
